                <h5>Background</h5>
                </br>
                <p>Red Door Family Shelter is a Toronto-based non-profit organization whose mission is to provide emergency shelter and support for women and children affected by domestic abuse, families experiencing a housing crisis, and refugee claimants with nowhere else to turn.
                </p>
                <h6>The Problem</h6>
                <p>The current Red Door website does not align with the stakeholders goals. The stakeholders want donors to have easy access to make donations through the website. They also want to boost community engagement through volunteering.</p>
                <h6>Stakeholder Interview</h6>
                <p>We had the opportunity to conduct an interview with the stakeholders of Red Door Family Shelter. This gave us valuable insights into the Red Door’s goals and the frustrations of the stakeholders.
                    The primary goal of the non-profit organization’s website was to increase community engagement, which in turn would increase donations and volunteers. The stakeholders wanted to ensure that the website had a clear path for their users to make donations and sign up for volunteering.</p>

                <h5>User Research</h5>
            </br>
                <p>To better understand how we could address the problem effectively, we conducted a series of user interviews. A few of the questions we asked included:

                    What factors influence you when deciding which organizations to donate to?
                    Tell us more about the type of non-profit organization you are willing to donate to.
                    What are your frustrations/pain points when donating?
                    After conducting 5 user interviews, we created an affinity map to group the common themes that occurred in the data we collected. By doing this, we were able to understand users’ emotions, thoughts, and feelings about donating to non-profit organizations.</p>

                    <p>We furthered our research by conducting 5 user tests on the current website (on most desktop and mobile) to get an idea of users’ experience on the existing website.

                        We gave the users the task of making a donation to the organization. Users were able to accomplish the task, but with difficulties.
                        
                        On the current Red Door website, there are multiple ways to donate on the homepage. These links directed users to multiple donation pages that looked different. This is where the users were confused. They were eventually able to complete the task, but a huge frustration was that it was not easy to find out how to donate.
                        
                        
                <h5>Definition and Ideation</h5>
                <p>Problem Statement

                    The current Red Door Family Shelter website does not align with the goals of increasing donations. Red Door Family Shelter needs to increase donations, community engagement, and boost volunteers.
                    
                    User Persona
                    
                    After conducting the research, we created a user persona based on the interview data and tests we did. We decided to make our user persona a family who has a goal of giving back to the community.</p>
                <div class="box">
                    <div class="imgBox">
                        <img src="">
                    </div>
                    
                <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
                <p>We did an empathy map to identify users’ pains and gains, as well as to understand users’ emotions.

                </p>
                <h6>Feature Prioritization Matrix</h6>
                <p>We organized the feedback that we received from the user interviews into a feature prioritization matrix in order to know which features would work best on the new website.</p>
                <h6>Style Guide/Tile</h6>
                   <p>The visual elements of the style guide were established by our team. We changed a couple of things:

                    We moved away from the bright red color and made it a darker red, almost maroon. We found that it was easy on the eyes.
                    We made the ‘Donate’ button easier to find.</p>
               
                <h7>Paper Sketches</h7>
                <p> We all sketched potential website designs that could work. We made sketches of the basic idea of information architecture for the website. This gave us the basic structure of how the website would look.</p>>

                <h8>Hi-Fi Deisigns</h8>
                <p> Once we researched and organized the current website, we started designing the final screens. We decided that it was easier for users to choose their preferred donation type by toggling between the options under ‘Ways to Give’. This was easier than having to go back to the homepage and figure out which link would take them to their preferred donation type.</p>
            <h9> Final Thoughts</h9>
            <p> This was a great project to work on, and it definitely felt rewarding. My teammates and I worked really well together and everyone did their roles. This is definitely one of the projects I am most proud of!
